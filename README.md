## Challenges
- Parsing through 10,000+ line response from Google Vision API to find necessary information
- Creating algorithm that attaches corresponding price to item
- Fixing problem when values for the price would come be returned from the API as separate numbers
- Accounting for edge cases for different types of receipts

## Tech/Framework Useed
<b> Built with </b>
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) frontend
- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) backend
- [Semantic React UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) styling
- [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr) optical character recognition 

## Features
- uploads photo of receipt and returns each item and its cost along with the totals and tax
- allows for edits of costs and calculates tip 
- assign or split each item between friends 

## Installation

3. run 'rails s' (will default to localhost:3000)

Frontend
1. clone frontend repo and run 'npm install'
2. run 'npm start' (will prompt you to run on another port, hit 'y' and run on port 3001)
